			<h1>2. Defining the ‘Previous year’</h1>
			<p>Previous year or the financial year or your tax year is the 12-month period that begins on 1st April and ends on the 31st March of the next year. When you start your new job, your tax year starts on the date of your joining and closes on 31st March and a new tax year starts on 1st April and so on. So, it is important to plan your taxes for each financial year.

			<h1>3. Assessment Year</h1>
			<p>It is a term you will often hear in relation to tax filing. It is a year after the previous year in which you will ‘assess’ and file your return for the previous year. So, assessment year is 2020-21 for the previous year 2019-20.<br><br>
Assessment year is the year in which you will file your tax return for the previous year. For instance, if you start your job on 1 July 2019, your tax year closes on 31 March 2020. 2019-20 is your previous year and your Assessment Year is 2020-21. The last day to file your tax return is 30 November 2020. Generally, the last date of filing ITR is 31st July after the end of previous year but the same has been extended to 30th November 2020 by the government due to COVID-19 pandemic effect.</p>

			<h1>4. Understand your Salary</h1>
			<p>When you start your job – understand your payroll or reach out to your HR department and get your <b>Salary details/ Pay Slip / Tax Statement. </b>Here, you will get an idea of the major components of your salary and how much tax will be deducted from your salary based on them which is also termed as TDS. This can immensely help you in restructuring your salary in a desired way to reduce income tax on your hard-earned income.
			<br><br>
<b>Example:</b> Most companies provide HRA to their employees. So if you live on rent in city other than your home city or you live on rent because you don’t have your own residential property then you can inform your employer about the same and claim HRA as deduction from your income.

			<h1>5. Income on which you pay Tax</h1>
			<p>Besides the salary income you receive in case of salaried employee, you may be earning an income from several other sources such as income from house property, capital gain income from sale of shares or mutual fund or sale of house property, income from other sources like dividend income or interest from saving bank account and income from business & profession. Your Total Income is sub-divided in 5 heads and is the sum-total of all heads of income which are enumerated below:</p>

			<h1>6. Deductions</h1>
			<p>Deductions result in reduction from your Gross Income. Income Tax Department allows you to reduce your taxable income by allowing certain deductions such as LIC premiums paid, medical premiums paid, investment in NPS, NSC, Fixed deposits, ELSS, etc. The more you make use of the deductions allowed, the lower tax you shall pay. Deductions are allowed under various sections of income tax act such as section 80 (section 80C to 80U) among others.
 <br><br>
<b>Sum of All heads of Income = Gross Income </b><br>
<b>Gross Income – Deductions = Taxable Income</b>

			<h3>7. Make Section 80C your best friend</h3>
<p>Section 80C is the highest tax saving section which can reduce your gross total income by Rs 1,50,000. Given below are some of the most popular investment options under this section.</p>
<h3>a. PPF</h3>
<p>One of the most widely used deductions under 80C is deposits to Public Provident Fund or PPF. When you open a PPF account, you need to deposit a minimum of INR 500 and a maximum of INR 1,50,000 in a year. Money deposited earns interest @ 7.1% p.a.(currently) compounded annually. Interest earned is exempt and withdrawal of deposited amount at the end of lock-in period is also exempt. However, we suggest PPF deposits to people aged between 40-50 years as there is 15 years lock-in period under this scheme.</p>
<h3>b. Tax-saving FD</h3>
<p>The taxpayers who are most conservative can invest their hard-earned money in fixed deposits. Fixed Deposits assure capital protection as well as a considerable interest income for investors. To get tax benefits under 80C, there is a lock-in period for at least 5 years. It is safe, but unlike PPF the interest income from it is taxable.</p>
<h3>c. Tax-saving mutual funds or ELSS</h3>
<p>This is one of our most preferred instruments as the return on investment is highest among all the tax saving ways available under section 80C and lock-in period is only 3 years which is the lowest among all the options available for claiming deduction. Equity Linked Savings Scheme is becoming popular among people for its historically higher performancs. However, we do not advise ELSS to those who are highly risk averse because ELSS involves market risk.</p>
 
<p>There are certain other investment instruments under section 80c and under various other sections. Visit this page(link)</p>
 <br>
<h3>8. TDS or Tax deducted at source</h3>
<p>Let us understand the concept of TDS with an example. As tax is deducted based on your income tax slab, similarly, if you earn interest from a Fixed Deposit, the bank also deducts TDS. Since the bank does not know your tax slabs, they usually deduct TDS @ 10%, unless you have not mentioned your PAN (in that case a 20% TDS may be deducted). TDS is deducted by the person making payment whether it is salary payment, payment for contract, professional fee, etc. The TDS must be deducted at certain percentage on an amount payable based on the rules prescribed by the income tax department. For example, an employer will estimate the total annual income of an employee and deduct tax on his Income if his Taxable Income exceeds INR 5,00,000. The employee can also provide form 15g/15h in case he proves that his taxable income will be less than Rs 5,00,000 after claiming all the deductions.</p>
<br>
<h3>9. Calculating Tax Payable</h3>
<p>Now as we have discussed our income sources and deductions that you can claim to reduce your taxable income, let us understand how to calculate the tax payable on your taxable income. There are 4 tax slabs for individuals under old scheme and 7 tax slabs under new scheme, tax slabs and tax rates according to tax slabs are applied and final tax payable is calculated. On the tax computed additional cess @ 4% is charged and then final tax payable is computed. It is important to note that from this tax payable, the TDS amount that has already been deducted shall be reduced to arrive at the amount of tax payable from your pocket.</p>
<br>
<h3>10. Standard Deduction</h3>
<p>As per the Budget 2018, salaried employees were entitled to a standard deduction of Rs 40,000 from the gross salary. This standard deduction replaced the medical reimbursement amounting to INR 15,000 and transport allowance amounting to Rs. 19,200 in a financial year.
Now as per Budget 2019, the standard deduction allowed to the salaried employees has been raised from 40,000 to 50,000. It is available to all the salaried employees.</p>

<p>Mr Amitabh is a 23-year-old software engineer living in Mumbai. This is his first job, and he is clueless about tax or savings. It is already mid-February and Amitabh came to know from his friends talking about Section 80C and how they pay zero tax on their income. Amitabh earns Rs 6,72,000 annually. Here are how his salary details will look like:</p>

<p>Amitabh looked up his payslip and found out that his employer has been deducting a TDS on his salary of Rs 3,198 each month. This shall work out to Rs 38,376 for the whole year. While Amitabh has been busy enjoying his new life and new financial freedom of his first job, he has no clue how much tax he needs to pay and whether he has any options to reduce his tax or pay no tax at all.</p>
 <br>
<h3>Let us help him out.</h3>
<p>Amitabh should first find out his total income from all sources. Besides salary income, he earned savings bank account interest of Rs 7,500. He also earns FD interest of Rs 4,500. He is not sure whether any TDS has been deducted on his interest income – so for that purpose he looks up his Form 26AS. Form 26AS tells about details of all the tax deducted and deposited against his PAN. He found TDS of Rs 3,198 deducted by his employer each month until January. Here is Amitabh’s total Income:</p>

<p>Now Amitabh lives in a rented accommodation in Mumbai along-with 4 other roommates and his share of rent is Rs 10,000. If he is able to organize rent receipts from the landlord and get his PAN number, he can claim an exemption on HRA. If he can submit the rent receipts – his employer will be able to adjust his tax calculations.</p>

  <br>
  
  <p>Did you notice! If Amitabh optimizes his tax saving investments and manages to claim Rs 1,50,000 under section 80C – no tax shall be payable by him on account of rebate claimed under section 87A. With this deduction, his taxable income does not exceed Rs 5 lakh which is eligible for rebate under section 87A for the AY 2020-21. However, it is mandatory for Amitabh to file his taxation because his gross total income is above the basic exemption limit of Rs 2.5 lakh. Also note that the TDS paid by him on his salary can be claimed as tax refund.</p>
 
<p>The investment under section 80C can be made under various options as discussed earlier in this blog. If you are not sure which are the suitable investment plans for you, click here.
